- The original methods used in Philip T. Dunwoody, Joseph Gershtenson, Dennis L. Plane, and Territa Upchurch Poole's "The fascist authoritarian model of illiberal democracy‚Äù are applied to new data. The goal of the methods was to explain antidemocratic attitudes using a model: antidemocratic behaviors can be explained by authoritarian traits, threat, and conspiracy thinking. Data was collected from surveys given out to three groups of students: Juniata College, the University of North Georgia, and the Universidad Autonoma de Chiapas, Mexico (UACM). the first method uses Cronbach's alpha to measure how reliable the components that make up the model to measure antidemocratic attitudes are. Reliability was acceptable only for a couple of the components for US groups. Reliability was unacceptable across most components except threat and conspiracy thinking for the UACM student group. The second method involves using Hierarchical Linear Regression to model total antidemocratic attitudes for all student groups and individual student groups. Results showed that adding one of the components, Conspiracy thinking, to the model was not needed to describe overall anti-democratic attitudes as only a small amount of added information was accounted for. On the contrary, Forward-step regression (FSR) analysis was applied as a variable selection technique and showed that using all components -- Authoritarianism (ASC), Threat, and Conspiracy thinking is essential in describing the full model explaining total antidemocratic attitudes for the combined student group. This was not true for individual student groups when applying FSR.
